## ABOUT
Hello all, I'm Aayush and I am a recent graduate from Duke University with a Bachelors of Science in Economics, and a minor in Mathematics in the Class of 2023. I'm 27 years old, and have lived in Mumbai apart from my college years. I had to take a medical leave of absence for a few years due to some undiagnosed pain. While the pain has been diagnosed as neurological chronic pain, the pain management has gotten a lot better with physiotherapy.  I have always been interested in data and statistics, and the biggest reason for this is my relationship with football - it's not just a sport, it's a religion to me. Therefore, I had to delve deeper into the statistics and data if my team isn't doing well. 

Since graduating in 2023, I have been working on acquiring certifications and learning essential languages such as SQL and Python, and exploring data visualization tools such as Tableau, Power BI, and Looker Studio. The two certifications I have completed are the DataCamp Data Analyst Associate Certification, as well as the IBM Data Analyst Specialization Certificate. I am also currently working in a Management Internship at Jamshri Realty Limited, which used to be a textile mill now converted into real estate space for retail and hospitality. 

Welcome to my Portfolio. Please explore the variety of projects available, and any feedback is much appreciated. 

## PORTFOLIO PROJECTS 

### PERSONAL PROJECTS 

#### Electronics Store Sales Project 

[Dataset](https://github.com/aayushd97/Pandas-Project/tree/master/SalesAnalysis/Sales_Data)
[Data Cleaning & Analysis](Personal-Projects/Electronics-Sales-Analysis)

Description: In this project I explored and concatenated 12 different monthly datasets for Electronics sales, in order to analyze the yearly consumer trends and gain consumer insights such as "What Hour of the Day is best to run an Advertisement?". This project involved analyzing the dataset through pandas - used for data cleaning and analysis - and matplotlib for the graphs. There are also some potential business insights based on findings through analysis in the notebook. 

Skills: Pandas, Matplotlib, Data Visualization

#### IPL Match Data (2008-2020) Project
[Dataset](https://github.com/aayushd97/Projects-Datasets/tree/main/IPL-Datasets)
[Exploratory Data Analysis using SQL](Personal-Projects/IPL-EDA-Script.sql)

Description: In this project I explored IPL match data from 2008-2020, answering different problem questions to understand who the top performers in IPL have been over the years. I performed data cleaning by changing data types and removing redundant. I also performed data exploratory data analysis using skills such as subqueries, running sums, partitioning and more in order to answer the unique problem statements. 

Skills: SQLServer, Subqueries, EDA

#### HR Analytics Power BI Dashboard

[Online Dashboard on Power BI Service](https://prodduke-my.sharepoint.com/personal/ard44_duke_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fard44%5Fduke%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FHR%2DAnalytics%2DDashboard%2Epbix&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fard44%5Fduke%5Fedu%2FDocuments)

Description: This project was a beginner-level project in Power BI, and the goal of the product was to analyze the type off attrition from the HR Database Dataset. Power Query was used in order to clean of the dataset (removing null values, spelling errors, handling duplicates). The correlation of attrition with several other variables, such as age, distance from home, salary, years spent at company etc. was measured through Power BI tools. 

Skills: Power BI, Power Query, Dashboard Creation 

#### Coffee Sales Excel Dashboard
[Dataset](https://github.com/aayushd97/Projects-Datasets/blob/main/coffeeOrdersData.xlsx)
[Dashboard](Personal-Projects/Coffee-Sales-Dashboard.xlsx)

Description: This project is used to showcase advanced Excel skills, including XLOOKUP and INDEX to complete certain columns with missing information. Then, I used PivotTables and PivorCharts in order to analyze the data, and create a dashboard with slicers and filters. 

Skills: Excel, PivotTables, LOOKUP, INDEX, Dashboard Creation

#### Manchester United Player Statistics Looker Studio Dashboard 
[Dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/93c79dc7-6ef1-4b94-9594-4c17428bc246)

Description: This project is something I have been wanting to create for a long time - a dashboard where the user can select a season, select a player, and the corresponding statistics and graphs appear on the page. While this is an initial version of my project, I hope to keep improving upon this and adding data from older seasons too. This dashboard was made using Looker Studio, and the data was sourced manually from fbref.com. Since the data was entered manually, data cleaning was not required. 

Skills: Dashboard Creation, Looker Studio

### IBM Data Analyst Specialization Certificate Projects

#### Capstone Project

[Dataset](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DA0321EN-SkillsNetwork/LargeData/m1_survey_data.csv)
   [Data Wrangling](IBM-Data-Analyst-Specialization-Capstone-Project/Data-Wrangling.ipynb)
   [Exploratory Data Analysis](IBM-Data-Analyst-Specialization-Capstone-Project/Exploratory-Data-Analysis.ipynb)
   [Data Visualizations](IBM-Data-Analyst-Specialization-Capstone-Project/Data-Visualizations.ipynb)
   [Dashboard](https://eu-gb.dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/dashboards/17175b19-0492-4a2b-b770-9a73bda92b79/view/5e7fdf7d17a231cc67e7e6e4079f2e017462715eb1bb870bd3d37b4959347397a96012c7c87e1e09dc170660a5ef465eca)

Description: As part of the final capstone project of the course, I did an analysis on the M1 Survey Data, which collected information from people in the IT sector. The information varied from demographics, to knowledge of languages and salaries. The first step of the project was cleaning the data by removing duplicates, missing values, and normalizing data. The second step was to do Exploratory Data Analysis on the data, followed by making data visualizations of important variables. All these steps were done on Jupyter notebooks. The last step involved creating a dashboard using IBM Cognos Analytics. All links are provided above. 

Skills: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NumPy, IBM Cloud, IBM Cognos Analytics, Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Dashboards

#### Data Visualization Project 

[Dataset](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DV0101EN-SkillsNetwork/Data%20Files/historical_automobile_sales.csv)
[Matplotlib, Seaborn and Folium Visualizations](IBM-Data-Analyst-Specialization-Data-Visualization-Project/MatPlotLib-Seaborn-Folium-Visualizations.ipynb)
[Dashboard Code Using Plotly, Dash](IBM-Data-Analyst-Specialization-Data-Visualization-Project/Dashboard-Code.py)
[Dashboard](https://aayushd97-8051.theianext-1-labs-prod-misc-tools-us-east-0.proxy.cognitiveclass.ai/)

Description: In this assignment I was tasked with creating plots which answer questions for analysing "historical_automobile_sales" data to understand the historical trends in automobile sales during recession periods. This project involved analyzing the dataset through visualizations using MatPlotLib, Seaborn, and Folium. It is also involved creating a dashboard using Dash and Plotly - however, this part of the project was slightly more guided than the others. 

Skills: Data Visualization, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Folium, Dash
