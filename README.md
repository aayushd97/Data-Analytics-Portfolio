# Aayush Damani - Data Analytics Portfolio
## ABOUT
Hello all, I'm Aayush and I am a recent graduate from Duke University with a Bachelors of Science in Economics, and a minor in Mathematics in the Class of 2023. I'm 26 years old, and have lived in Mumbai apart from my college years. I had to take a medical leave of absence for a few years due to some undiagnosed pain. I have always been interested in data and statistics, and the biggest reason for this is my relationship with football - it's not just a sport, it's a religion to me. Therefore, I had to delve deeper into the statistics and data if my team isn't doing well. 

Since graduating this year, I have been working on acquiring certifications and learning essential languages such as SQL and Python. The two certifications I have completed are the DataCamp Data Analyst Associate Certification, as well as the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. I am looking to create and build my portfolio now, while also being open to gaining some experience through work opporunities in the next year.
