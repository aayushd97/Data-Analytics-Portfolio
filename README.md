# Aayush Damani - Data Analytics Portfolio
## ABOUT
Hello all, I'm Aayush and I am a recent graduate from Duke University with a Bachelors of Science in Economics, and a minor in Mathematics in the Class of 2023. I'm 26 years old, and have lived in Mumbai apart from my college years. I had to take a medical leave of absence for a few years due to some undiagnosed pain. I have always been interested in data and statistics, and the biggest reason for this is my relationship with football - it's not just a sport, it's a religion to me. Therefore, I had to delve deeper into the statistics and data if my team isn't doing well. 

Since graduating this year, I have been working on acquiring certifications and learning essential languages such as SQL and Python. The two certifications I have completed are the DataCamp Data Analyst Associate Certification, as well as the IBM Data Analyst Specialization Certificate. I am looking to create and build my portfolio now, while also being open to gaining some experience through work opporunities in the next year.

Description: As part of the final capstone project of the course, I did an analysis on the M1 Survey Data, which collected information from people in the IT sector. The information varied from demographics, to knowledge of languages and salaries. The first step of the project was cleaning the data by removing duplicates, missing values, and normalizing data. The second step was to do Exploratory Data Analysis on the data, followed by making data visualizations of important variables. All these steps were done on Jupyter notebooks. The last step involved creating a dashboard using IBM Cognos Analytics. All links are provided above. 

Skills: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NumPy, IBM Cloud, IBM Cognos Analytics, Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Dashboards

### IBM Data Analyst Specialization Certificate Data Visualization Project 

[Dataset](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DV0101EN-SkillsNetwork/Data%20Files/historical_automobile_sales.csv)
[Matplotlib, Seaborn and Folium Visualizations](IBM-Data-Analyst-Specialization-Data-Visualization-Project/MatPlotLib-Seaborn-Folium-Visualizations.ipynb)

Description: In this assignment I was tasked with creating plots which answer questions for analysing "historical_automobile_sales" data to understand the historical trends in automobile sales during recession periods. This project involved analyzing the dataset through visualizations using MatPlotLib, Seaborn, and Folium. It is also involved creating a dashboard using Dash. 

Skills: Data Visualization, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Folium, Dash
