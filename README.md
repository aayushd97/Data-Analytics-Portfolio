## ABOUT ME
Hello all, I'm Aayush and I am a graduate from Duke University with a Bachelors of Science in Economics, and a minor in Mathematics in the Class of 2023. 

Since graduating in 2023, I have been working on acquiring certifications and learning essential languages such as SQL and Python, and exploring data visualization tools such as Tableau, Power BI, and Looker Studio. The two certifications I have completed are the DataCamp Data Analyst Associate Certification, as well as the IBM Data Analyst Specialization Certificate. I am also currently working as a Data Analyst at Core Integra since August 2024, before which I was working as a Business Analyst at Jamshri Realty Limited from December 2023 to July 2024.

Welcome to my Portfolio. Please explore the variety of projects available, and any feedback is much appreciated.

Description: As part of the final capstone project of the course, I did an analysis on the M1 Survey Data, which collected information from people in the IT sector. The information varied from demographics, to knowledge of languages and salaries. The first step of the project was cleaning the data by removing duplicates, missing values, and normalizing data. The second step was to do Exploratory Data Analysis on the data, followed by making data visualizations of important variables. All these steps were done on Jupyter notebooks. The last step involved creating a dashboard using IBM Cognos Analytics. All links are provided above.
